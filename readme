# Text Segmentation with TextTiling Algorithm and BERT

This project implements BERT encoding and TextTiling algorithm with LDA, for topic segmentation of textual data. It segments a document into coherent and non-overlapping
segments based on the depth scores calculated using the algorithm.

## Features

- Tokenization of sentences
- Calculation of coherence scores and depth scores
- Automatic determination of threshold for segmentation
- Segmenting the document into coherent segments
- Generating an output text file with segmented sentences
